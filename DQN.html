<p>In this post I am going to talk about Deap Q Learning (DQN). The main idea is based on two papers that were published in 2013 and 2015 by Google Deepmind. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602.pdf">firt one</a> is a NIPS paper and lets call it DQN1. The <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf">second paper</a> is a nature paper and we call it DQN2 in this post. </br>
DQN1: Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning</br>
DQN2: Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning </br>
